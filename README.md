# LeetCode-Solutions

---

This repository contains my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) 
problems. Each problem is solved in multiple languages including, but not 
limited to:
- Java
- Python
- C
- C++
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- C#
- PHP
- Go
- Rust

Each folder corresponds to a specific problem and contains subfolders for 
each language. There are two ways I approach each problem, the optimized 
version and the clean version. They will each have their respective solutions
in language sub-folders.
